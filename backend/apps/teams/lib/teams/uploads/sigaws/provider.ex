defmodule Sigaws.Provider do
  @moduledoc """
  This behavior defines the callbacks expected from an implementation needed
  for signature verification.

  The `pre_verification` callback is expected to use the context data to
  verify/validate the request. All the information available for verification
  are passed in `Sigaws.Ctxt`. This callback should return `:ok` when
  verification passes or return `{:error, atom, binary}` when it fails.
  At the minimum return an error when:

  -    region is not one of supported regions
  -    service is not one of supported services
  -    request expired (based on `signed_at_amz_dt` and `expires_in`)

  The `signing_key` callback is called only when
  `pre_verification` succeeds without any error. This key should be generated
  as outlined
  [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-v4-examples.html).
  The returned key is used to recompute the signature to verify against.
  A helper function to generate this (`Sigaws.Util.signing_key/4`) is provided
  for convenience. This approach of relying on a callback to get signing key
  instead of requiring the secret enables better key managment if desired.
