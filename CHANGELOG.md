# Changelog

## Unreleased
- Replaced the Telegram/Matrix HTTP clients with queue-driven bridge facades for Telegram, Matrix, IRC, and XMPP plus a shared `ServiceBridge` helper and in-memory queue adapter tests.
- Introduced a queue behaviour contract to standardise `bridge/<service>/<action>` envelopes with trace IDs for all connectors.
- Updated bridge strategy, architecture, account linking, and platform research docs to focus on StoneMQ-backed daemons and MTProto-based Telegram support.
