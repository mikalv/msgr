# Slack-Compatible Umbrella Messaging Platform Plan

## Goal
Create an umbrella messaging service that exposes a Slack-compatible API surface, enabling existing Slack-integrated software to function with minimal or no modifications while providing a foundation for interoperability with other platforms (e.g., Telegram, Discord).

## Guiding Principles
1. **API Fidelity**: Mirror Slack's Web API and RTM (or Event API) semantics closely, prioritizing high-usage endpoints and payload formats to minimize adapter friction.
2. **Modular Transport Layer**: Separate the API gateway from message transport connectors to allow protocol-specific adapters (e.g., Matrix, custom realtime infrastructure).
3. **Extensibility**: Design internal events and data models to support additional platform adapters (Telegram, Discord) without major refactors.
4. **Security and Compliance**: Support OAuth flows, scopes, and audit logging comparable to Slack to satisfy enterprise integrations.
5. **Observability**: Provide comprehensive metrics/tracing to debug integration issues from third-party Slack clients.

## High-Level Architecture
- **API Gateway**
  - HTTP server implementing Slack Web API routes, including authentication, rate limiting, and payload validation.
  - WebSocket/Event delivery service mimicking Slack's RTM or Events API behavior.
- **Core Services**
  - **Identity Service**: Manage workspaces, users, bots, tokens, and OAuth credentials. Maintain Slack-compatible identifiers.
  - **Conversation Service**: Handle channels, direct messages, threads, reactions, and message history with Slack-like metadata.
  - **Message Orchestrator**: Normalize messages into internal canonical format; trigger delivery to connected transports.
  - **File Service**: Manage file uploads, storage, and secure access URLs mirroring Slack's file API.
- **Adapter Layer**
  - **Slack Compatibility Adapter**: Translates internal models to Slack API responses and websocket events.
  - **External Platform Adapters** (future): Connect to Telegram, Discord, etc., using internal canonical events.
- **Data Layer**
  - Event-sourced or append-only message store to facilitate message sync across adapters.
  - Search indexing (e.g., OpenSearch) for Slack-like search endpoints.

## Implementation Phases
1. **Discovery & Prioritization**
   - Identify top Slack endpoints used by target integrations (e.g., chat.postMessage, conversations.list, users.info).
   - Map OAuth scopes and permission models.
2. **MVP Slack Compatibility**
   - Implement OAuth/token issuance, workspace provisioning, and bot/user identity.
   - Build core conversation/message services with Slack-style IDs and timestamps.
   - Support chat.postMessage, conversations.list/history, users.list, reactions, and file uploads.
   - Provide RTM/Event API-compatible WebSocket stream for message events.
3. **Integration Validation**
   - Test with popular Slack bots/integrations; ensure Slack SDKs (Python, JS) work seamlessly.
   - Add rate limiting and monitoring instrumentation similar to Slack's documented limits.
4. **Enhanced Features**
   - Add interactive components (slash commands, block kit support) and workflow triggers.
   - Implement admin APIs, audit logs, and enterprise grid-like features if needed.
5. **Multi-Platform Expansion**
   - Introduce canonical message schema that abstracts platform-specific features.
   - Build Telegram/Discord adapters that translate between canonical events and each platform's API.
   - Provide unified admin dashboard to manage cross-platform channels and mappings.

## Telegram vs. Discord Priority Assessment
- **Telegram**
  - Pros: Open bot API with minimal friction, popular for automation; simpler permission model.
  - Cons: Less parity with Slack features (threads, reactions) without workarounds.
- **Discord**
  - Pros: Rich event model (threads, reactions, voice), closer to Slack's community-style usage; strong webhook support.
  - Cons: OAuth flow more complex; rate limiting stricter; compliance considerations.

### Recommendation
1. **Telegram First**: Faster to implement and validate cross-platform routing thanks to straightforward bot API and widespread adoption in automation contexts.
2. **Discord Second**: Requires deeper feature mapping but offers higher value once Slack parity is solid.

## Open Questions & Next Steps
- Determine compliance requirements (SOC2, GDPR) that might dictate data residency decisions.
- Decide whether to leverage Matrix or build a custom realtime backbone.
- Evaluate licensing/legal implications of Slack API compatibility.
- Prototype Slack-compatible endpoints and run against Slack SDK unit tests.
- Draft migration guides for third-party developers transitioning from Slack tokens to our platform.
