# Bridge Strategy and Rollout Plan

## Vision
Create a unified messaging experience where a single Msgr identity can transparently interact with external chat ecosystems (Slack, Telegram, Discord, Matrix, XMPP) without users needing to context-switch. The bridge layer must preserve security, respect platform policies, and minimise reverse-engineering surface area.

## Strategic Objectives
1. **Single Inboxes** – Deliver messages from external platforms into Msgr while retaining metadata (sender, channel, timestamps).
2. **Persona Impersonation** – Allow users to reply as their external personas with correct display name, avatar, and permission scopes.
3. **Separation of Concerns** – Keep platform-specific logic modular to support rapid evolution and compliance updates.
4. **Auditability & Trust** – Provide traceability for legal and enterprise compliance, especially when impersonating users.

## Phased Plan
### Phase 0 – Research & Legal Discovery
- Map each platform's official API surface, rate limits, and terms of service.
- Identify necessary reverse engineering only when official APIs are insufficient; document risks.
- Establish legal review process and ToS compliance guardrails per platform.

### Phase 1 – Prototype Ingestion
- Stand up a generic connector interface (gRPC or NATS RPC) with a stub implementation.
- Implement read-only ingestion for Slack (Events API / RTM) and Telegram (Bot API + userbots) via official methods.
- Store messages in a normalised event schema (conversation, external message id, payload) with provenance metadata.

### Phase 2 – Outbound Impersonation
- Build credential vault for storing per-platform tokens (OAuth, session cookies) with rotation policies.
- Support message send for Slack (OAuth user token) and Telegram (MTProto user session) with impersonation guardrails.
- Implement policy enforcement so outbound messages require explicit user consent per workspace/server.

### Phase 3 – Discord, Matrix, XMPP Connectors
- Discord: start with bot API, extend to user impersonation via reverse-engineered gateway if required.
- Matrix: leverage existing Matrix client-server API; use application services where possible.
- XMPP: implement native XMPP client with roster sync; rely on Msgr's internal message bus.
- Add adaptive rate limiting, message deduplication, and federated presence mapping.

### Phase 4 – Unified UX & Automation
- Integrate connector management UI (link accounts, view status, rotate tokens).
- Provide per-conversation routing rules (e.g., Slack channel ↔ Msgr workspace).
- Offer automation hooks (webhooks, workflow engine) for cross-platform message routing.

### Phase 5 – Hardening & Enterprise Rollout
- Security audits, penetration testing for bridge infrastructure.
- Observability dashboards (latency, failure rate, deliverability).
- Enterprise features: audit log export, data retention policies, administrative override workflow.

## Key Milestones
- **M0**: Legal green-light for first platform.
- **M1**: First message mirrored from Slack into Msgr test environment.
- **M2**: Successful impersonated reply posted back to Slack via Msgr.
- **M3**: Discord + Matrix connectors in beta, XMPP GA.
- **M4**: Enterprise compliance artefacts delivered.

## Risk Mitigation
- Maintain pluggable connector interface to disable a platform quickly if policies change.
- Keep reverse-engineered components isolated in sandboxed microservices with clear boundaries.
- Continuous integration tests against mock servers to catch regressions before hitting production APIs.
