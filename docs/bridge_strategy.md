# Bridge Strategy and Rollout Plan

## Vision
Create a unified messaging experience where a single Msgr identity can transparently interact with external chat ecosystems (Telegram, Matrix, IRC, XMPP, Slack/Discord later) without context switching. The bridge layer relies on queue-driven daemons so the Elixir core stays thin while each protocol evolves independently.

## Strategic Objectives
1. **Single Inboxes** – Deliver messages from external platforms into Msgr while retaining metadata (sender, channel, timestamps).
2. **Persona Impersonation** – Allow users to reply as their external personas with correct display name, avatar, and permission scopes.
3. **Separation of Concerns** – Keep platform-specific logic in queue-connected daemons so we can mix languages (Go, Python, Rust) per protocol.
4. **Auditability & Trust** – Provide traceability for legal and enterprise compliance, especially when impersonating users.

## Phased Plan
### Phase 0 – Research & Legal Discovery
- Map each platform's protocol requirements, rate limits, and ToS (focus on ToS-free IRC/XMPP for early wins).
- Identify libraries or reference clients that accelerate MTProto, Matrix, and XMPP support.
- Define queue envelope contract (`bridge/<service>/<action>`) and security expectations (trace IDs, signatures).

### Phase 1 – Queue Infrastructure & Skeleton Daemons
- Deploy StoneMQ (or equivalent) and build Elixir publisher/request helpers (`ServiceBridge`).
- Implement stub daemons for Telegram, Matrix, IRC, and XMPP that echo payloads to validate round-trips.
- Establish contract tests and schema definitions for envelopes and responses.

### Phase 2 – Ingestion MVP
- Expand daemons to maintain read-only sessions (Matrix sync loop, Telegram MTProto updates, IRC log tail, XMPP MAM sync).
- Persist inbound events in Msgr and publish acknowledgement envelopes (`ack_update`, `ack_sync`, `ack_offset`, `ack_receipt`).
- Surface daemon health/metrics via queue responses for observability.

### Phase 3 – Outbound Impersonation
- Store encrypted session material in Credential Vault; implement request/response linking flows.
- Enable outbound intents for Telegram, Matrix, IRC, and XMPP using daemon-managed credentials.
- Add policy enforcement hooks that inspect intents before publishing to the queue.

### Phase 4 – Additional Platforms & Automation
- Introduce Slack/Discord connectors via the same queue contract once ToS/legal work is complete.
- Provide automation hooks (webhooks, workflow engine) triggered by inbound queue events.
- Build operator tooling to drain queues, replay envelopes, and rotate daemon credentials.

### Phase 5 – Hardening & Enterprise Rollout
- Conduct security audits on queue protocol, daemon binaries, and credential storage.
- Deliver observability dashboards covering queue depth, daemon latencies, and failure categories.
- Ship enterprise artefacts: audit log export, retention policies, delegated admin approval flows.

## Key Milestones
- **M0**: Queue envelope contract + StoneMQ bindings validated in staging.
- **M1**: Telegram/Matrix read-only ingestion flowing into Msgr via daemons.
- **M2**: First impersonated Telegram/Matrix/IRC/XMPP message sent via queue intent.
- **M3**: Slack/Discord connectors piloted on queue contract; automation hooks live.
- **M4**: Enterprise compliance artefacts delivered with full audit/logging coverage.

## Risk Mitigation
- Maintain pluggable connector interface to disable a platform quickly if policies change.
- Keep reverse-engineered components isolated in sandboxed microservices with strict boundaries.
- Continuous integration tests against mock daemons and replayed traces to catch regressions before hitting production networks.
