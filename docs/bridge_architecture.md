# Bridge Architecture Overview

## Component Map
- **Connector Microservices**: One per external platform, written in language best suited for that ecosystem (e.g., Go for Slack/Discord gateway, Rust for MTProto). They implement a common interface: `connect()`, `subscribe()`, `sendMessage()`, `syncState()`.
- **Message Bus**: NATS or Kafka topic namespace bridging connectors with the core Msgr backend. Topics segregated by tenant/workspace and platform to enforce isolation.
- **Normalization Service**: Translates platform-specific payloads into Msgr's canonical message/event schema and persists them in Postgres.
- **Impersonation Service**: Holds outbound routing logic, selects correct connector, enforces permission scopes, and signs requests with stored credentials.
- **Credential Vault**: Hardware-backed (HSM/YubiHSM or cloud KMS) store for OAuth tokens, cookies, session secrets. Exposes short-lived signing tokens to connectors.
- **Compliance & Audit Layer**: Centralized logging pipeline (OpenTelemetry) with append-only audit store.

## Data Flow
1. **Inbound Messages**
   - Connector receives webhook/event stream → publishes to Message Bus.
   - Normalization service consumes, transforms, stores, and triggers notifications to Msgr clients.
2. **Outbound Messages**
   - Msgr client sends message → core backend writes to queue → Impersonation service retrieves user credentials, applies policy, forwards to connector.
   - Connector translates to platform API call, handles ack/ retry, publishes delivery status events.
3. **State Synchronization**
   - Periodic sync jobs pull history, membership changes, reactions.
   - Diff engine merges states and resolves conflicts (e.g., deleted messages, edits) before updating Msgr.

## Security Layers
- Per-connector sandbox (container isolation, AppArmor/seccomp) to contain reverse-engineered code.
- Mandatory TLS mutual auth between connectors and core backend.
- Fine-grained access tokens for Msgr users, scoped to connector capabilities.
- Policy engine to enforce DLP, workspace rules before impersonated send.

## Scalability Considerations
- Horizontal scaling of connectors per workspace using Kubernetes deployments.
- Rate limiting and burst control based on platform limits, enforced via leaky-bucket counters in Redis.
- Idempotent event processing using external message IDs and dedupe tables.
- Fallback queues for temporary platform outages, with exponential backoff and operator alerts.

## Observability
- Metrics: message throughput, latency per platform, error categories.
- Tracing: distributed traces correlating inbound/outbound events across services.
- Alerting: threshold-based alerts for failure rates, lag in sync jobs, credential expiry warnings.

## Developer Experience
- Provide mock servers for Slack, Telegram, Discord, Matrix, XMPP to run integration tests offline.
- Contract tests validating canonical schema compatibility per connector.
- Feature flags to enable connectors gradually per user cohort.
